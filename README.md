This is a script that you can use to automatically patch discord with betterdiscord, and automatically (re)start Discord afterwards.

BetterDiscord is really annoying to use nowadays, because every discord update un-injects it.

<h2>NOTE: This can potentially eat tons of disk-space. The reason is that for the love of god i cannot find a way to delete the folder afterwards, without countless errors with bd's dependencies(mainly some babel shit). Technically if you use a modern version of Windows, it should automatically Clean up your Temp Directory, but in case it doesn't (or you just feel like starting discord that often is a neccessity) make sure to clean it up from time to time manually (C:\Users\yourUser\AppData\Local\Temp).</h2>
